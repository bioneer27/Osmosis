Mouse Release on reserve piles
Click through deck restart?

*Only allow mouse clicks on wastePile if there are no more available moves from reserves

Undo Deal Cards? Yes/No?
	One at a time?
	Weird case where you can't go back anymore
Make sure that you can only add to the next foundation.  Not any foundation

Should the Piles only show after all four?




***Release on wastePile isn't handled
***Clicking on wastePIle shouldn't increment
Can only do available moves

Undo deal returns three cards to deck
